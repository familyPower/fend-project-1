      <h4 class="text_underline">Questions About the Project:</h4>
      <p>I had trouble combining &lt;figure&gt; with &lt;picture&gt;, especially when I tried to align the caption to the bottom right of the image. I found that the &lt;figure&gt; and the &lt;picture&gt; had separate boxes. I also had trouble re-sizing
        the boxes. Know of any examples doing this? I couldn't find any on the web.
      </p>
      <p>I found that at least one picture was oriented incorrectly. I found that I could use css' transform to rotate the image. But I had to use "transform: rotate(45deg)". Why "45deg" instead of "90deg".
      </p>
      <p>I had to include and outer most &lt;div&gt;. I'm not sure why, when I removed it (I don't think it should be needed), the header doesn't isn't responsive, at least not correctly. Any idea why? You can see the issue by removing the outer most &lt;div&gt;
        and shrinking the viewport to the size of a phone.
      </p>
      <p>How do I reposition the dropdown so that the right-side is aligned when the screen is small - phone size viewport. When the screen is small, long menu items in the dropdown fall off the screen.

    <section class="section-comments">
      <h4 class="text_underline">Comments:</h4>
      <p>Regarding the tutorials on <span class="text-underline">Responsive Patterns</span> - It would be nice to have a complete working example of each pattern, especially for those of us with virtually no experience in web programming. It is surprisingly
        hard to find complete examples focusing on topics I'm trying to learn.
      </p>
      <p>There are a couple of items that I wanted to improve. For example, I would like less space between section heading (e.g. Comments) and text. I would also prefer more space between the picture of me and the text to it's right. But I felt that I spent
        enough time on this project - I'm well over a month past the deadline; it's time to move on.
      </p>
      <p>There was a lot to learn, or at least become familiar with in this project - git, gulp, css, html, other unix tools (I'm come from a Windows world), responsive design, image manipulation, etc. It was fun, but it may have been a bit much to do in
        just one month.
      </p>
      <p> I designed the application to operate responsively from a screen size of an iPhone 5,about 220 pixels wide, up to a desktop of arbitrary size.
